Bug; After navigating from main user profile to another user profile
-stories-s component does not get destroyed

------
the modal view("dispatch story_seen for all user stories == user id" minus the story_id)
Replicate BUG
-Visit profile route 
-Go back to home route
-Click on story
-Story should return a different story in the modal window
Fix: Scrap getUserStories redux implementation
-Get pure stories directly from storyFeed
-Filter and retrieve the user stories in storyViewer
[]make as many components stateless as possible
keys: [] > not completed, [X] > completed, [-] > not important.
