possible solution
(event_scheduler time to run interval = 6hrs)
-Delete expired stories first from stories table
-Use normal query
(event_scheduler time to run interval = 12hrs) 
=Delete from seen 
-Use join query
(event_scheduler time to run interval = 12hrs)
-Delete from notification
-use join query

implelmentation
DELETE FROM stories WHERE  FROM_UNIXTIME(stories.story_time / 1000) > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestampadd(day, -1, now())) 

DELETE FROM seen USING stories INNER JOIN seen INNER JOIN notifications
WHERE  stories.story_id <> seen.story_id AND notifications.story_id <> 0

DELETE FROM notifications USING stories INNER JOIN seen INNER JOIN notifications
WHERE stories.story_id <> notifications.story_id AND notifications.story_id <> 0
